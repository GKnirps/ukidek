The History of ùkidek
=====================

Year 4 of ùkidek, diary of baron Grahar Vabôktad
------------------------------------------------

### 1st Granite, 253

I've been thinking. Now that I am a baron, I will probably never get to found a peaceful, prosperous fortress in the middle of nowhere. I'm stuck here, threatened by necromancers and the ever advancing threat of the war front. Well, there is an old proverb in the Unions of Bath, our allied human civilization: ”When life gives you muck roots, make swamp whiskey.“

If I want to have a good life here, we need three things:
- outer security, which includes trained and equipped fighters
- inner security, which includes happy dwarves and a working legal system
- prosperity

Unfortunately, I am not the overseer and only have limited power right now. So I better

I was just interrupted by one of our peasants. I can't remember her name (it's probably Urist or something like that). She told me they don't have any volunteers for a new overseer, so I have to take over the job. Perfect!

#### Addition

I spent most of the time yesterday to get up to date on what is going on in the fortress. For the last two years, I mostly relayed work orders and took inventory, so I was not really up to whatever important stuff was going on.

#### nobility and holdings

Most importantly, I found out that I am not the only baron in ùkidek. Aban Momuzdeduk, the baron of Machineflashed and his wife reside here as well. Machineflashed is apparently a medium-sized hillocks. Aban migrated to ùkidek before he became baron. When his father died last summer, he was the replacement. I asked him he wanted to return to Machineflashed. He doesn't. He said he never lived in Machineflashed, and neither did his father.

Aban also told me that barons have the right to have much nicer rooms than both of us have today.
![My current room and furniture. I require a better office, a better dining room and a better tomb.](img/year-04/01-grahar-holdings.png "Not even decent!")

Oh, did I mention that Aban has a bedroom fit for a king? He has this legendary armor stand is his bedroom. Unbelievable! I am *the* baron of Dinnerbrains. He ist just a baron of some unimportant Hillocks he doesn't even care for.

Alåth the mayor also complained about his dining room. We need some larger rooms with high-value furniture. The current situation is unbearable.

#### Happiness

After the Sazir incident last year, it became evident that our dwarves need a way to relieve stress. We currenlty have no assigned performer in our inn. Our inn is also to small, I get complains about crowded tables.

All the animal skeletons left outside are also a problem. Some of them are even the remains of pets, which is a bit traumatizing for some of our weaker minded. Not to mention that having half a dozen skeletons lying outside is a considerable threat, given that we have already been attacked by necromancers twice.

There are several Workshops outside, which means dwarves have to work outside. **Outside!** No wonder everyone here is traumatized. Even the children play outside!

![Dodòk Masterquake: ”I was nauseated by the sun. So disgusting…“](img/year-04/02-child-nauseated.png "At least she has a choice. Our tanners do not.)

We also have only one kind of booze and are quickly running out of it.

Our biggest morality problem however is that we don't have any space to pray. This needs to be changed quickly.

So, four steps do be done:
1. create a temple for everyone who wants to worship any kind of god.
2. create three temples for the most worshipped gods in our fortress
3. clean up the outside, move the workshops inside
4. produce a larger variety of brewable crops
5. dig another, larger dining hall in addition to the existing one

#### Security

As mentioned before, childs play outside, dwarves work outside. The outside is covered in animal skeletons just waiting for a necromancer to appear.

Our melee militia is completely unequipped and untrained. Our only qualified carpenter is part of the militia. We need her, we cannot affort to lose her.

The fortress guard on the other hand is at least equipped with leather armor (well, as far as we have leather armor) and weapons. On the other hand, some of our most skilled Stoneworkers are part of the fortress guard! Also, the captain of the guard keeps complaining about having no prison for criminals. We have no prison. We need to dig out some room for one.

![Our Captain of the guard was frustrated considering the scarcity of cages and chains.](img/year-04/03-missing-prison.png)

At least our marksdwarves are equipped and training. The zombie-shooting-range is still not working, but we can fix that.

Regarding the weapons and other equipment, we need a forge first. However, we have not struck magma yet. We need to dig deeper. And there is a rumour about a monster in the first cavern layer. After investigating these rumours, I got the following description:

![A towering eyless oriole. It has a long, swining trunk and it has a bloated body. Beware its deadly spittle!](img/year-04/04-ngalak.png)

”How do you know its appearance?“ I asked the bard who told me about it. Have you seen it? ”Of course not“, he answered, ”Overseer Gusto walled of this whole cavern. That was before the beast appeared“.

”Then how do you know how it looks like?“ He shrugged. ”Experienced miners can feel the vibration of the rock and can tell the shape of monsters.“

Maybe I shouldn't have asked. However, until our militia is better trained and equipped, I will not open the cavern again. Better safe than sorry.

#### Prosperity

We need more space to produce stuff and store the raw materials. Most importantly, we need to get to the magma sea to build smelters and forges. A pottery and a glas furnace may also help to produce high-value trade goods and furniture.

As mentioned before, we also need a larger variety of booze. And more booze. We only have 41 servings left, with a fortress population of 137 (including resident performers, but not including short-time visitors). At this rate, we will be dry by the end of the month. We also have a gigantic plump helmet field and over six hundred plump helmets. We should replace this with several smaller but more diverse farm plots.

We also have lots of mussel shells lying around. Maybe we can craft some trinkets with them. I don't want to imaging what those necromancers will do if they raise over a hundred mussel shells at the same time. This is scary.

So, long story short:
1. dig to the lava sea
2. build forges and smelters
3. optimize booze production
4. replace the plump helmet plot with a more diverse field
5. Make shell crafts
6. start a pottery and glassmaking industry


#### Dead Bards

After reorganizing some labours (especially reducing the number of our fisherdwarves to one), the peasant was at my door againm asking me what to do with the dead bards. Apparently, some bards dropped dead, dying of old age. I told her to just bury them, but she told me there weren't any empty graves left. She knows more about what's going on in this fortress than me. Maybe I should make her my assistant.

![Medtob Ingtakineth and Etur Rigòthborlon, bards have been found dead](img/year-04/05-dead-bards.png "Hide behind the mount of dead bards")

I just sent her away, with a production order for more coffins when the shouting started.

![Intruders! Drive them away!](img/year-04/06-necromancer-intruder.png "We are so dead.")

I ordered everyone inside. On their flight, our people counted some more intruders. Necromancers! Just as I feared. But before they got to raise our killed livestock, they fled.

![A list of necromancers](img/year-04/07-necromancers.png "Who knows how many more are hiding in the tall grass?")

Not a moment to soon, it seemed:

![A vile force of darkness has arrived!](img/year-04/08-siege.png)

The Gates close with a loud **THUNK**. One of the last people to get in was the elven diplomat, scolding me about cutting trees. As if I had no other problems. What a day.

### 4st Granite, 253

From various reports I gathered an approximate number of enemies:

- 25 goblin soldiers, riding on
- 25 beak dogs
- 10 trolls
- 14 elves, part of the performance troupe ”The Calm Cacti“ (or maybe they have just a bad timing).

![The intruding goblins and trolls](img/year-04/09-goblins.png They are quite fast on their beak dogs)

Right now, we can hear the agonizing sound of our livestock and pets being killed. Why were the pigs outside anyways? They don't even need the grass!. I order our miners to dig an undergroun pasture for the next time some goblins arrive.

Oh, and I also orderd Lolor's bedroom to be walled off. It still had a hole in the ceiling, leading outside. The problem with the workshops outside solved itself, by the way. The trolls destroyed them.

### 7th Granite, 253

It has become silent outside. What are they planning to do?

### 10th Granite, 253

We are almost out of booze, and since our only water supply is outside, we need to see if the goblins actually left.

### 11th Granite, 253

Outside is a stinking hell of rotting cadavers. The goblins killed all of our livestock that was outside, a wild elephant and some visiting human fighters. All in all, they only lost three trolls to traps. I don't know why they are gone. The elven performance troupe was not attacked.

On the plus side, we opened the gates just in time for the elven caravan to arrive. Most of their goods are useless, but right now we need booze. They also may have some useful trained animals. We need to replace our killed livestock.

Oh, and apparently, we have no crafts to sale. I ordered our stonecrafter to make some for the humans in the summer. For now, I will just sell prepared meals.

### 15th Granite, 253

The elves brought a frickin' grizzly bear! If they bring another one next year, we may even be able to breed them!. I also bought some fruit to have some variety in booze. I got this all for one pot of prepared meals. I even bought some wood from them because it was cheap and we may need to make charcoal to produce steel in the future.

### 16th Granite, 253

The new burial cave is dug out, the coffins are placed as I write this. They are below our living quarters. This is also where I will place our temples. Oh, did I mention we have no hospital yet? I recently replaced our chief medical dwarf with someone more experienced, but that does not help if there is no hospital.

![The burial cave and the designated temple](img/year-04/10-graves-and-tempel.png)

### 23rd Granite, 253

Some migrants have arrived. I will sort them out later.

Ingish created a masterful statue of Lêgan, the god of truth. This will be the centerpiece of our new general temple. I also plan to create a temple for Ekurkidet, the goddess of suicide, death, war and fortresses. I think we need this temple.

The booze supply is still critically low, but we still manage to produce enough to not be totally dry. Oh, and we have cherry wine now. Alåth wanted to use it for her new roast recipe, but I prevented that.

### 24th Granite, 253

Whoa. We have about fourty immigrants. Some cattle and a donkey foal (which I immediatly placed on the new underground pasture), many children and some dwarves with weapon skills. A high master brewer (right on time), an adequate Blacksmith (better than nothing), two master mechanics and a great woodworker. All in all some great additions to the fortress. We need more rooms, though.

### 2nd Slate, 253

We make progress on many fronts. I have breached the second layer cavern again and ordered stairs to be built downwards. When that is done, I will wall the stairs off.

![Stairs (partially constructed) in a cavern)](img/year-04/11-cavern-stairs.png "What can possibly go wrong?")

The main temple makes progress, the statue is about to be placed. We still need doors, though.

![A room with a not-yet-placed statue](img/year-04/12-temple-construction.png)

We enlarged the workshop area. I also ordered new baracks do be dug out, since we need the old baracks for workshops. I put the new baracks close to the entrance hall, so the militia can act quickly against an outside threat. We also have another melee squad. I intend to build baracks for them somewhere close to the cavern shaft, so they can act quickly against beasts from the cavern.

![Enlarged workshop space](img/year-04/13-workshops.png "More space for our craftsdwarves")
![Designated new baracks](img/year-04/14-new-baracks.png "Our squads will love it.")

I just don't have the capacity to enlarge our inn now. But it is very crowded. See for yourself.

![A crowded inn](img/year-04/15-overcrowded-inn.png "It is hard to get to the emergency bridge levers in here.")

### 8th Slate, 253

Today I asked one of our resident animal trainers if they can train those caged dogs for war. Turned out those aren't dogs. They are dingoes. We can train them to not attack dwarves and livestock, but they will never be a war dog that is true to its master. Well, maybe we can breed them for meat.

### 9th Slate, 253

We breached the third cavern layer. And it's got a magma pool. This means we don't have to dig down all the way.

![A cavern with a partially visible magma pool](img/year-04/16-third-cavern.png "There is even some garnierite!")

And even better! Gusto told me they found adamantine in that cavern! This is stuff of legends! I will wait befor mining it though. It is only worth to be processed by the most legendary smiths.

![Raw adamantine! Praise the miners!](img/year-04/17-raw-adamantine.png "Let's dig deeper.")


### 11th Slate, 253

I don't want to dig further down before we sealed of the caverns. Instead, I orderd some new rooms to be dug out.

![Designated bedrooms](img/year-04/18-new-bedrooms.png)

### 12th Slate, 253

The main temple has been opened today. It still needs some smoothing, but we finally have a place to pray at.

### 2nd Felsite, 253

The miners have finished digging out the new rooms, so I can finally move on to get appropriate rooming. I also designated some rooms for the baron of Machineflashed. I designated them to be dug out west of the great hall.

![Designated noble quarters](img/year-04/19-noble-quarters.png "I hope they are not too small")

I roughly plan to dig even more elaborate rooms on the layer below, in case the king ever decides to pay us a visit. That reminds me. I have some notes laying around here, some even from the visit of the outpost liaison in 250. Back then I was to busy to read them. I handed them over to my successor. The seal is still intact, though. Meh, can't be that important. I'll just read them tomorrow.

### 3rd Felsite, 253

Holy Lêgan!

> The king is dead, long live the queen!

I should *really* read those memos on time. King Fikodkadôl was killed in an elven attack in the early summer of 250, only three month after he sent me to found Dinnerbrains. His eldest daughter, Bëmbul Boatsholy became queen after him.

The king was twenty years younger than me. I am suddenly very happy that I am not in Bridgehill anymore.

### 9th Felsite, 253

The garbage drop that Gusto installed is finally in working order.

![A garbage dump and a lever](img/year-04/20-garbage-dump.png "It smells")

The garbage is on a floor hatch that can be opened with a lever. The garbage is dropped several stories. In the future, I would like to move it a few tiles to the east, so we can drop our garbage into the magma pool. For now, we just let it drop into an unused hole.

Here is how to empty it:
1. Make sure no one is in the garbage drop room
2. Lock the door to the garbage drop room
3. Pull the lever besides the garbage drop room twice
4. Unlock the door

I also marked the skeletons outside to be dumped. Less fooder for necromancers. 

### 15th Felsite, 253

The second and third cavern layers are now completely separated from our staircase. As soon as the miners finished digging out the noble quarters, we can start designing the smelter and forge area.

Our booze stock has been quadrupled since the start of the year. We now have about 160 servings of booze, which is not much, but we are on the right way. We also have more different kind of drinks, which is a nice change.

![Eight different kinds of alcoholic beverages](img/year-04/21-booze-variety.png)
