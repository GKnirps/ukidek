The History of ùkidek
=====================

Prologue
--------

### 3rd Granite, 250
I can't believe it! I, Grahar Vabôktad, get a personal audience with our king Kadol Fikodkadôl. I suppose it is about my proposals to colonize the uninhabited parts of this world. There are so many places where we can build a peaceful, propsering settlement, become wealthy and make a monument of dwarven artisanship.

It has been quiet the last few years. The elves and humans are peaceful, the goblin civilisations are weak and kobolds have become rare. Our civilisation, Atorushat (or ”The Perfect Basement“ in the common tongue) has many hillocks, fortresses and mountain halls. No one challenges the dwarven dominance in this world.

### 4th Granite, 250
I just returned from the audience with King Fikodkadôl. General Sengnish was there as well. ”Grahar“, the king told me, ”We have decided to entrust you with an important mission. For too long, misguided humans and dwarves have terrorized the south of our peninsula on the Riddled Continents. In their towers they perform unnatural rites, raising zombies from the death and attack nearby hillocks to get supplies for their unholy experiments. We cannot let Our subjects suffer this way, so We have decided to build a fortress in the Laborius Dunes to protect Our subjects and eventually destroy those necromancers once and for all.“

Well, this was not the peaceful industrial mission I was hoping for. Still, this was a great ooportunity to show my worth. ”This is a great honour my king“, I replied. ”I will start with the preparations right away. I think we can manage to embark early in the summer. I think a force of fifty construction workers and soldiers should be sufficient to dig a basic fort, once we have set up basic defences, more dwarves can follow.“

The general exchanged a look with the king and replied: ”This would be the usual procedure. Unfortunately we are under a Budget due to the war with The Lakes of Meditation. Those puny elves have occupied a former dark fortress of the goblins and defend it like cave dragons. You can pick six dwarves as companions, we will give you a budget for the basic necessities and tell everyone about our new fortress, so volunteers will come after a few months. We have scheduled the fortress to be founded in the middle of this month, so you better hurry.“

I was aghast. There were so many problems with that so I just spoke the first thing that came into my mind: ”Mylord, if you tell everyone about an upcoming fortress of this size, don't you think the necromancers will try to destroy it before it is dangerous to them? Pardon me for asking, but what shall we do if they attack us before we have recruited enough fighters?“

”Lock the door“, the king replied. ”And hope they don't have zombie trolls“, the general added. Well, that isn't very reassuring.

### 10th Granite, 250
We are on our way to the designated place for our new fortress. I estimate to arrive there on the 15th Granite. I have found some dwarves to start this mad project. Most importantly, we have a talented architect and mechanic, who will help us to build defensive structures no zombie can overcome.

I decided to take no anvil with us and instead bought a breeding pair of pigs and chicken. With only seven of us, we won't be able to built a forge before the autumn anyways. A trade caravan is supposed to visit us in the autumn, so we can just by an anvil when they arrive.

I got a map of where we are supposed to found the fortress:
